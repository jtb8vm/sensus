# SensusR

SensusR is a package written for the [R Statistical Computing Environment](http://www.r-project.org). The purpose of SensusR 
is to make ingest, analysis, and visualization of Sensus data straightforward.

## Installing SensusR
There are several options for installing SensusR.

### From CRAN
SensusR is available directly through [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SensusR/index.html), but you should 
probably install it via the usual method (`install.packages` on the command line or through the menu system in RStudio).

### From Source
You can also obtain source packages for SensusR directly from the Sensus 
GitHub [repository](https://github.com/MatthewGerber/sensus/tree/master/SensusR/Releases). If you download one of these 
source archives, use the following command to install the package, editing the path appropriately for your machine:

    install.packages("/path/to/SensusR_VERSION.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")

In the above command, VERSION is the SensusR version that you are installing. After installation, call `library(SensusR)` to 
load the package and see the package help for details on available functions and their use. Some notes on these releases follow:

* 2.1.0:  In order to plot location data, you'll need to reinstall the `ggmap` package from source with `install.packages("ggmap", type = "source")`.

## Obtaining Sensus Data
The approach to obtaining your Sensus data will depending on how you have configured your <xref:Sensus.Protocol>. In particular, 
it will depend on your choice of <xref:Sensus.DataStores.Local.LocalDataStore>, <xref:Sensus.DataStores.Remote.RemoteDataStore>, 
and configuration of each. We typically use the <xref:Sensus.DataStores.Remote.AmazonS3RemoteDataStore>.

## Releasing SensusR
The following steps were adapted from http://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-check-your-package-with-r-devel.

1. Run `sudo pkgutil --forget org.r-project.R.XXXX.fw.pkg` so that the installer does not overwrite your current R installation. 
   In this command, `XXXX` is your Mac OS version. This can be found with `pkgutil --packages | grep r-project`.
1. Rename your R.app and R64.app or move them temporarily into another folder, as the installer of R-devel probably will replace 
   them by new version that are not compatible with your existing stable R version.
1. Install [R-devel](http://r.research.att.com) if you haven't already.
1. Install [RSwitch](http://r.research.att.com/#other).
1. Use RSwitch to change to your normal version of R and then build the SensusR source package within RStudio via Build > Build 
   Source Package. Move the resulting package to the `SensusR/Releases` directory.
1. Use RSwitch to change to R-devel.
1. Install packages which your own packages depends on. You have to do it from source, as the binaries for the R-devel do not 
   exist. As of SensusR 2.0.0 this command is `install.packages(c("jsonlite","lubridate","plyr","sp","ggmap","ggplot2"), type = "source")`. Note 
   that ggplot2 requires the jpeg package. In order to install the latter from source you first need to install jpeg via Homebrew using `brew install jpeg`.
1. Check the package:  `R CMD check SensusR/Releases/SensusR_2.0.0.tar.gz --as-cran`
